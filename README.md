## General info
The goal of the project is to implement a simple desktop application in C #, working in the user's graphical environment, using the WPF framework (UWP, fluent UI, ...). Mini-games was part of a semester long project for our second year at the WSEI. We have chosen to develop this games because it appeared to us as a complete exercice in adequation to our level.
